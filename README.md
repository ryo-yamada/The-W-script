# The W script

### Gabo's Nightmare

This is an executable script designed for the game called "The W".

I am actively updating this script. Updates may take long but are well made.

Execute the script below into your executor and it'll automatically load. Works with Solara and more.
Script:

`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryo-yamada/The-W-script/main/raw%20obfuscated'))()`

CURRENT VERSION: v1.2
